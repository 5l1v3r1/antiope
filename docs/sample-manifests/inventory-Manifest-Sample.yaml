# deploy_stack.rb Manifest file generated from cloudformation/Inventory-Template.yaml on Wed Sep 26 18:29:55 EDT 2018


# These control how and where the cloudformation is executed
StackName: PREFIX-ENV-aws-inventory
OnFailure: DO_NOTHING # accepts DO_NOTHING, ROLLBACK, DELETE
Region: us-west-2
TimeOut: 15m
# You must specifiy LocalTemplate or S3Template but not both.
# LocalTemplate: cloudformation/Inventory-Template.yaml

# Paramaters:
# There are two kinds of parameters, regular and sourced.
# Regular parameters are static and defined in the Parameters: section of this yaml file
# Sourced are parameters that cfnDeploy will go and fetch from other Stacks.
# This simple Serverless app does not depend on any other stacks. However if we start using VPC based
# Lambdas, or have multiple stacks that need to interact, we will want to use Sourced Parameters

###########
# Parameters to the cloudformation stack that are defined manually.
###########
Parameters:
  # Arn Name of the Role the lambda needs to assume to do cross account Access
  pAssumeRoleArn: arn:aws:iam::*:role/Security-Audit

  # How frequently the StepFunction should Run (As a CloudWatch ScheduleExpression)
  pExecutionRate: rate(30 minutes)

  # Comma Delimited list of payer accounts to process
  pPayerAccountList:

  # Default name of the AssumeRole to assume into accounts
  pRoleName: Security-Audit

  # DynamoDB Table Read Units
  pTableReadUnits: 50

  # DynamoDB Table Write Units
  pTableWriteUnits: 50

  # <optional> IAM Username with access to the Inventory Bucket
  pIamUserName: srv_antiope_inventory_dev

###########
# These stacks are needed by the SourcedParameters section
###########
DependsOnStacks:
    # - MyOtherStack

###########
# Parameters that come from other deployed stacks.
# Valid Sections are Resources, Outputs Parameters
#
# Hint. Get your list of resources this way:
# aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources --stack-name MSC-DEV-VPC-EAST-1 --output text | awk '{print $2, " ", $3, " " $5}'
###########
SourcedParameters:
  # The Pre-install script needs this to sed into the lambda ARN.
  # pVPCID: MyOtherStack.Outputs.VPCID
